# pg-utils
Utilities for Pygame creations

pg-utils provides utilities such as a world class that organizes sprites into layers and a camera class which interprets everything as being in world coordinates.
The original central feature was the global coordinates system meant to simplify the creation of large worlds for the player to move around in.

The utils now also include a chunk generating utility, and there are plans for animation handling utils as well.
